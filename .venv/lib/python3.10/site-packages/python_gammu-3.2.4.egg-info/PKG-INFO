Installing
==========

You can install in a usual way for Python modules using distutils, so use
``setup.py`` which is placed in the top level directory::

    ./setup.py build
    sudo ./setup.py install

You can also install it using pip installer::

    pip install python-gammu

Requirements
============

To compile python-gammu, you need Gammu development files (usually shipped as
``libgammu-dev`` or ``gammu-devel`` in Linux distributions).

The location of the libraries is discovered using ``pkg-config``,
``GAMMU_PATH`` environment variable and falls back to generic locations. In
case it does not work, either install ``pkg-config`` or set ``GAMMU_PATH``.

On Linux something like this should work::

    GAMMU_PATH=/opt/gammu python setup.py build

On Windows::

    SET GAMMU_PATH="C:\Gammu"
    python setup.py build


Documentation
=============

Please see included python documentation::

    >>> import gammu
    >>> help(gammu)

Alternatively you can use Sphinx to generate browsable version, which is
also available on-line at <https://wammu.eu/docs/manual/>.

Feedback and bug reports
========================

Any feedback is welcome, see <https://wammu.eu/support/> for information
how to contact developers.
